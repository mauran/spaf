#SPAF

SPAF is a basic PHP framework, without any bells and whistles.
The goal of SPAF is to provide an easy to use (for programmers) framework, for which to build web-applications in PHP upon.

SPAF contains a simple class structure, where classes are placed in a folder and are automatically included in runtime.
SPAF also contains a simple templating system based on simple HTML with enabled enhancements like Bootstrap and Fontawesome, and inclusion of PHP snippets.

That's about it. All SPAF is about, is getting started quick with development, without the hassle of setting up the basic application base every time.
